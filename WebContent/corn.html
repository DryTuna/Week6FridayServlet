Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from 
agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, 
mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes 
in Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own 
right outside of Council Bluffs. 
		</p>
		<p>
Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope 
that your family gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Corn Maze 
as we did building it! Our family would like to invite your family to 
come out and visit us at this year's Corn Maze and AutumnFest. 
		</p>
		<p>
Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is filled 
with twist and turns that's good fun for adults and kids alike! See how 
adventurous you are as you wind through the maze while taking an interactive 
quiz. Answer the questions correctly and receive additional clues to solve 
the maze. For families with young children, our maze is filled with jokes, 
riddles and quests. Try to be the first in your group to punch out your quest 
card by visiting the secret spots. This maze is the perfect size and height 
for little ones. Resting places and educational displays are scattered throughout.
		</p>

There is no water available in the maze. Make sure you bring water bottles 
with you! No one under the age of 12 will be allowed in the maze without 
an adult at any time.
